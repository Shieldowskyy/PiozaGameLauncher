An open source game launcher for Dasho Games titles and more!

# Opening project in Unreal Engine
PiozaGameLauncher is built on Unreal Engine. It was easier for me to write something in Unreal Blueprints for simpler prototyping, but i have plans to rewrite some elements in C++ in future.
## Engine
To run this project, you have to install Unreal Engine 5.3 on your machine! Also you might need Visual Studio with configured Unreal Engine components to compile all plugins and C++ code!
## Plugins
To open project you need to install these plugins:\
[RuntimeArchiver](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeArchiver)\
[RuntimeAudioImporter](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeAudioImporter)\
[RuntimeFilesDownloader](https://github.com/gtreshchev/RuntimeFilesDownloader)\
[EasyFileDialog](https://github.com/unrealsumon/EasyFileDialog)\
and\
[File Helper Blueprint Library](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/file-helper-bp-library) from Marketplace
### Optional
> [!NOTE]
> While you might already be able to run the project without these plugins, I recommend installing them so that it can start without any problems.

You can also install Sentry Unreal plugin to report all crashes to me. It will be helpful for investigating further problems!\
